    <h1>Why Pandas Are Awesome</h1>

    <p>
      Despite their exalted status and relative lack of natural predators, pandas are still at risk. 
      Severe threats from humans have left just over 1,800 pandas in the wild.
      This peaceful creature with a distinctive black and white coat is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China. 
      Pandas live mainly in bamboo forests high in the mountains of western China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. 
      They must eat from 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, a formidable task for which they use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.
      A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but can grow to up to 330 pounds as an adult. 
      These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.
